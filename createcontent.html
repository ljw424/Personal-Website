            <h3>Balanced argument based on Outlaw by Michael Morpurgo<br><br></h3>

            <p>Is the Sherwood Tax fair?<br><br>

                Every time someone travels through Sherwood Forest, Robin Hood and his fellow outlaws are charging –what
                they are calling- the Sherwood Tax. When they ‘collect’ this tax, they have been heard to say that they
                only charge the amounts that people can afford and all the money goes to feed and clothe the
                impoverished, starved people of the forest. So is this a fair tax?<br><br>

                Today in England, there are many affluent people and a large amount of these have obtained their
                fortunes by unfair means. For example, many Lords and Squires have been awarded their lands by King
                John- who has stolen them unfairly from families which have owned them for hundreds of years- in return
                for their support in regaining territories in France. If these people have earned their fortunes at the
                expense of others, then surely it is only fair to ask them to share a small amount of their good fortune
                (for this is all Robin asks for) with people who are less fortunate than themselves.<br><br>

                In addition, unlike the King who spends the money he has collected in taxes on lavish parties and
                unnecessary wars, generous – minded Robin is simply taking money to help other people, selflessly using
                the money to provide food and clothing for the destitute people who inhabit the forest and taking none
                for himself: he is simply providing a charity for people who are in need.<br><br>

                On the other hand, how do the ‘taxpayers’ feel about having their money stolen from them? Not all are
                people who have been given lands and titles by the Sheriff; in fact, many of them are already victims of
                the Sheriff’s crimes. These people and their ancestors have worked tirelessly to earn their money, only
                to have it stolen, first by a treacherous King and secondly by foul-mouthed people who appear to be too
                idle to earn their own money. Surely, these layabouts should be working for a living- this would mean
                there would be no need for the Sherwood Tax and people could travel safely through the forest.<br><br>

                Finally, Robin claims that he only takes amounts that people can afford and even boasts about how he
                invites them to dinner around his cosy campfire; however, tales from his victims tell a different story.
                Making their way innocently through the forest, horses are shot between the eyes with an arrow, causing
                carriages to veer off the track and resulting in serious injuries to the travellers inside the
                carriages. While their personal possessions are rifled through by this band of outlaws, the casualties
                are held at knifepoint and threatened with death if they try to escape or summon help. Mockingly,
                victims are then invited to take tea with Robin and his fellow criminals – an offer which is always
                refused – before being sent on their way, with no carriage, no horse and no money. When presented with
                the other side of the tale, it seems that Robin is no better than his sworn enemy, King John.<br><br>

                After reading both sides of the argument on the Sherwood Tax, it is up to you to make up your mind about
                Robin Hood: is he a fair man, who is simply fighting on behalf of the poor for what is rightfully
                theirs, or is he a brutal and violent criminal who enjoys the thrill of ambushing innocent victims?</p>

            <h3>Persuasive letter against gangs<br><br></h3>

            <p>Dear Alex,
                I am writing to you to implore you to reconsider your decision to join a gang. There are so many deadly
                risks involved in being a gang member and I just know that once you are aware of these dangers, you will
                make the only possible choice and refuse membership of the gang.<br><br>

                The first point that I would like you to consider is related to the purpose of a gang. Most people who
                join gangs believe that they will be safer and that their fellow gang members will protect
                them, in the same way that your family work together to support each other. In fact, the reverse is
                true. At first, the other gang members may welcome you because they know that the more people they have
                in their gang, the more powerful they can be; however, at the first sign of any problems, each gang
                member’s main priority is themselves, which means that they would not protect you from danger or from
                the police if it meant putting themselves at risk. You may try to convince yourself that these gang
                members are your friends, but a true friend wants to be with you for who you are and would always stand
                by you in times of trouble.<br><br>

                Secondly, have you heard of the Joint Enterprise law? This concept has been created by the police and
                the government for one reason: to put an end to gangs. If a crime is committed, for example a serious
                assault, arson or even murder, anyone who was present at the time (or did something which led to the
                crime) can be arrested and charged. For example, if a knife is used by one of your fellow gang members
                to injure someone and you are present at the time, you will be charged, even if you were ignorant of the
                fact that
                they were carrying a knife with the intention of causing harm. You may think that it is possible to join
                a gang and that as long as you do not commit any criminal acts, there will not be a problem; this law
                clearly shows that this is not the case – being at the scene of a crime makes you just as guilty as the
                person who committed the crime.<br><br>

                Now that you fully understand the dangers related to being a gang member, I am certain that you
                will make the right choice. Standing up to people and resisting peer pressure is never easy but it is
                obvious that – if you want a safe and successful future –this is your only option.

            <h3>Story opening based on Outlaw by Michael Morpurgo<br><br></h3>
            <p>It was too late to turn back now. The beast roared and raged. Bravely, I marched forward into the
                driving snow; each unique flake was a dart hitting the bullseye. Shielding my eyes, I could sense the
                forest looked like a sinister snow globe shaken by a malicious child and accompanied by a howling wind
                which bit at my defenceless nose. With each step I took, the ground held me back, not wanting to reveal
                the secrets of its forest.<br><br>

                As if the White Witch had waved her wand, the darts turned to feathers falling softly after a pillow
                fight and my escape route was revealed. The trees were hunched over, covered by a white blanket, while
                icicles hung like daggers from the very ends of their bare branches. Defeated, some trees lay on the
                ground like slain giants. Nervously, I turned, realising that the thick cushion of snow would disguise
                the footsteps of my enemy. Like a prowling fox, I slipped unseen into the shadows.

            <h3>Conveying character based on Outlaw by Michael Morpurgo<br><br></h3>
            <p>“Who dares to trespass through my forest?” hissed the indistinct figure, shuffling towards an
                unsuspecting Robin Hood.
                “It is I...Robin Hood!” declared the boy, his fear disguised by his brave voice.<br><br>
                Like a burning poker, one elongated, rotting fingernail slipped out from behind the towering oak and
                traced an X onto Robin's delicate cheek, drawing a single drop of crimson blood, which dribbled to the
                forest floor. A deformed face followed. Robin gasped; his heart pounded in his ears. The unnerving eyes
                were mirrors reflecting the depths of hell and the jagged scars spoke of tales beyond even the most
                macabre imagination. With a sinister sneer upon his disfigured features, the creature (for that was the
                only way to describe him) approached Robin until his broad shoulders were level with the top of Robin's
                trembling scalp. Fearing for his life, Robin turned.</p>

            <h3>Journalistic writing based on Trash by Andy Mulligan<br><br></h3>

            <p><b>Police are investigating the alleged theft of an undisclosed amount of money which was taken from the
                    Mckinley Hill home of Senator Zapanta last week.</b><br><br>
                The theft (reported to be in the region of 6 million dollars) was reported when the Senator, who has
                been Vice-President of the country for 20 years, found that the money was missing from his safe. In a
                statement given to the Police, the Senator explained that the money was left to him in a will and that
                he was about to deposit the cash into the bank when it was taken.<br><br>
                When the crime was first reported, the Police had no obvious leads; however, it has since come to light
                that the Senator’s houseboy, Jose Angelico, 29, has not been seen since the theft and in a national
                exclusive, The Star, is able to reveal further details of the crime.<br><br>
                Our source, who wishes to remain anonymous, informed us that a new fridge had been ordered on the same
                day that the money went missing. On the day of delivery, the old fridge was removed from the property
                and Mr Angelico was seen accompanying the driver out of the secure compound, which Senator Zapanta calls
                home: the house-boy has not been seen since.<br><br>
                We spoke to Senator Zapanta’s maid- known only as Grace- who has worked in the mansion for four years.
                She told us, “I can say that Jose was kind, gentle, trustworthy and honest. His wife had died before I
                knew him
                and he was paying for his daughter to go to school. Jose Angelico was a good man.” There are now rumours
                that Mr Angelico’s mutilated body was found close to Behala Police Station but this has yet to be
                confirmed by Police.<br><br>
                Senator Zapanta, whose time in office has been marred by rumours of corruption and who is currently a
                key witness in the prosecution of his subsidiary company, was unavailable for comment; a spokesman
                told us that the Senator is in considerable distress but remains hopeful.<br><br>
                It remains to be seen whether the money will be recovered, particularly with the main suspect now
                believed to be dead, but the Police, who are funded by the Senator’s department are unlikely to rest
                until the culprit is caught and the money returned to its rightful owner.

            <h3>Persuasive Letter relating to poverty<br><br></h3>

            <p>Dear Sir,<br>
                I understand that you have interests in the rights of children and so wanted to inform you that I am
                extremely concerned about the desperate lives of millions of unfortunate children who live in extreme
                poverty on dumpsites in many developing countries all around the world including Kenya, South Africa,
                India and the Philippines. They face urgent problems which are not being dealt with effectively: they
                need your help.<br><br>

                Firstly, these ill-fated children are innocent victims of the punishing poverty which surrounds them;
                their families are locked into a vicious cycle of living hand to mouth, relying on the discarded scraps
                of unwanted trash which society discards. Scavenging for recyclable odds and ends from as soon as they
                can walk is all that many of these children can look forward to in life as they have little opportunity
                to break free from such a challenging existence- surely this has to change?<br><br>

                Secondly, such poverty adversely affects many aspects of their lives but especially their health.
                Unsanitary conditions, sharp objects and rotting rubbish all bring their own hazards but some of these
                dumpsites contain dangerous hospital waste, toxic chemical cocktails and disease-ridden vermin. Many of
                these children are malnourished, having little to eat, and they often die young. How can this be
                permitted in today’s society?<br><br>

                Finally, education, the only hope for scores of these young people, is often not provided or is out of
                reach. For some families, education is unaffordable as, even where primary education is free (such as in
                Kenya) parents and carers struggle to find enough spare money to buy compulsory uniforms or to pay
                one-off admission fees. Even where free education is provided, such as through mission schools run by
                international charities, most families keep their children away from the schools as they need their
                children to work on the trash sites in order to feed the whole family. Wouldn't you do the same if the
                alternative was starvation?<br><br>

                You may be wondering how you can help? Perhaps, you could ask a question in Parliament on my behalf to
                see how our country is meeting its obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of a
                Child which states that richer countries, like our own, should support poorer countries in ensuring that
                children receive their entitlement to food, clothing, a safe place to live and a good quality education.
                It is essential that we act now to make a difference to the lives of these children.<br><br>

                Yours faithfully,<br><br>
                Year 6

            <h3>Narrative based on Outlaw by Michael Morpurgo<br><br></h3>
            <p>“Nottingham’s men attacked us. They took her.”<br><br>
                Inches away from Robin, a single wooden arrow punctured the leaf-covered ground like a needle and was
                rapidly followed by two further, identical arrows which cast a deadly silence over the forest. The
                silence was quickly broken by a storm of noise which reached a crescendo when an army of a hundred
                fierce and savage Celts cascaded over the horizon as if a dam had been broken.<br><br>
                “To the trees!” came the cry from the Outlaws as weapons glinted in the fading light and soldiers (if
                that is what you could call this band of barbarians) besieged the wood. Peasants scrambled over each
                other in their haste to escape this intimidating sight while the Sheriff of Nottingham –who had planned
                this attack- looked on with grim determination: he would not leave the forest without Robin. While the
                Outlaws clambered ever higher, the thundering of hooves reverberated through the forest like an
                earthquake, leaving a trail of debris as determined riders closed in on their targets.<br><br>
                Kneeling on the trembling floor, Robin –who knew why the Sheriff had come- seized his sharpest arrow,
                closed one eye and took careful aim at the approaching soldier, knowing that this would hardly be
                sufficient against a thousand men.<br><br>
                “We won’t go down without a fight,” he muttered.<br><br>
                Appearing to move in slow motion, the arrow left the bow and sliced through the air, piercing the
                stomach of an oncoming attacker who fell to the floor with a groan of pain. Arrows flew from Robin’s bow
                one after the other, but on their own, they would never put an end to the onslaught. Above Robin, where
                a rickety wooden bridge stretched between the trees, his fellow outlaws came together in one final
                desperate attempt to end the battle. Lining up and simultaneously drawing back their bows, on the cry
                of, “Fire!” 50 arrows were launched into the path of the intruders who were unable to defend
                themselves.<br><br>
                The Outlaws began to sense a victory; however, their hope was short-lived.<br><br>
                On the bank to the side of the forest, rose one hundred soldiers each bearing a bow. Within each bow,
                was an arrow. At the end of each arrow, was a flame. In unison, the arrows were pulled back by the
                soldiers and fired, not towards the people, but towards the wooden huts, bridges and trees of the
                village.<br><br>

                together. Rising above the forest were the harmonies of a choir of insects and birds, worshipping Mother
                Nature, who brought life to them all.<br><br>
                Within the forest, gnarled trunks of aged trees plaited themselves together, venturing towards the
                canopy of trees, through which shafts of light appeared like spotlights highlighting the jewels of the
                land. Around the roots of the trees, the rivers and streams unwound like arteries carrying their life
                source wherever it was required; at the same time, the refreshing water quenched the thirst of the
                inhabitants of the jungle.<br><br>
                A step closer and the forest began to unveil it secrets. Raindrops adorned leaves momentarily, before
                gliding to the carpet of leaves below. Other leaves shivered as tiny insects tiptoed across the surface,
                using the veins as a map towards the hollows of the trees where they could feast upon the unseen life
                which rested within.<br><br>
                Then one day, OTHERS came.<br><br>
                The jigsaw of two halves was fractured into numberless pieces across the arid landscape, the river
                replaced by endless cracks cutting through the dark earth. The choir mourned the death of Mother Nature
                and the life that she had gifted to them.<br><br>
                Within what once was a forest, the sun burned the ground with no canopy remaining to protect the land.
                The trees, which had once stood like proud soldiers, lay defeated after battle, trunks unwound in
                sorrow. Any water still flowing through the arteries was simply there to smother the flames which
                flickered amongst the detritus.<br><br>

            <h3>Newspaper opening based on a nursery rhyme<br><br></h3>

            <p>Yesterday, at approximately 2pm, a 20 year old local resident, Mr Humpty Dumpty, was critically injured
                following a suspicious incident which took place on the boundary wall of Eggston Castle.<br><br>
                When the usually reliable Mr Dumpty did not report for patrol duty at the Castle, the King’s men became
                concerned about his wellbeing and launched a search of the Castle grounds; after several hours, the
                unconscious victim was discovered in a pool of yolk at the base of the Eastern wall. It is believed that
                the guard had been resting on his way to work when the incident occurred. An investigation has commenced
                and evidence gathered suggests that this may not have been an accident: a strip of red cloth was
                discovered attached to the wall.

            <p></p>Hi Gardo,<br><br>
            I hope this gets to you before the cops track you down. They’ve not been back again, have they?
            Well, I guess you were right when you said they’d come for us- they really are desperate to get their
            hands on the bag. I bet even you can’t guess what they’ll do to find it. They drove me straight to the
            station. It wasn’t too bad going past the shops but once we got to the smaller roads, part of me wished
            you were there with me. It was better that you weren’t though- one of us needs to stay safe.
            When we got to the station, they dragged me in. Please don’t tell anyone else- I made a right mess of
            myself cos I was so scared. I remembered what we’d heard about those other kids and I couldn’t help
            it.<br><br>
            I got taken into room six- that number’s burned on my brain. They started questioning me. I tried to
            stay quiet but it was impossible. I told them I’d found some money. Didn’t tell them where though. But
            then I couldn’t remember what I’d said before and everything started to go wrong- I think they knew I
            was lying.<br><br>
            On and on it went- the guy was REALLY mad by this point. Anyway, you know the stories- you wouldn’t
            think it could be any worse than those, would you? Well it was. These two men grabbed me- one had my
            ankle and one had my arm-and lifted me out of the window. I could see the filthy wall of the station: it
            was like a pit. Honestly, I wish I could have been braver but I screamed and screamed. I didn’t tell
            them though, I promise. I don’t know why- there was just a part of me begging not to give up. Maybe
            it was for José, maybe it was for you and Rat but I didn’t tell them nothing. It didn’t stop there
            though…on and on they went. They threatened me, Auntie, everyone I know.<br><br>
            Eventually-and I still don’t know why- I felt a hand on the back of my neck and I was taken out of the
            door, down a passage and down the steps. I ran. I couldn’t stop. I did it Gardo. I did it for José, for
            you and for Rat. I’m still alive and maybe I’ll even get back to you before this letter does. We need to
            get out of there before they come back. Look after Rat.<br><br>

            <h3>Letter from Mary Anning (extract)<br><br></h3>
            <p>It is clear that my findings, which you have profited from, make me one of the most eminent fossil
                hunters of these times; therefore surely granting me membership would only serve to further enhance the
                society’s reputation.<br><br>
                As you can see, my discoveries give me the necessary qualifications to join your society; however, you
                will not permit me membership because of my gender. What are women? Are they not made from the same
                flesh and blood as men? If it were my brother who had unearthed these ancient remains, where would he be
                now? At the very least, he would be an important member of your society, if not a world-renowned
                scientist, whereas all I receive is wild accusations of witchcraft, while I struggle each day to
                survive. Are we not all human? By excluding women, you are halving the opportunity for your society to
                progress and become even more successful. It is evident that the way forward is to permit women
                membership of your society.
